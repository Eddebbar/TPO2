# Tropical Pacific Oxygen Dynamics at the Mesoscale 

This book presents an analysis of the oxygen budget in the equatorial Pacific in an eddy resolving model of ocean circualtion and biogeochemistry.

Here we examine the role of physical and biogeochemical processes governing the structure and seasonal-to-interannual variability of the upper oxygen content and structure, and elaborate on pathways governing oxygen ventilation in this region.
